### 3.2. Data Verification Tool

#### 3.2.1. Overview

The data verification tool is an external script separate from the API, designed to ensure the integrity of datasets (e.g., `USA-roads.csv`). This command-line-only tool performs checks to validate the dataset's structure and usability. To use the tool, execute the script with the following format:

```
<script_name> <filename>
```

> [!NOTE]
> `<script_name>` is the name of the script file (e.g., `data_verifier`) and `<filename>` is the name of the CSV file you want to verify, provided it adheres to the correct data format.

> [!WARNING]  
> If the Data Verification Tool identifies any issues, an email should be sent to the client to notify them about the problem. The email should also include a request for a corrected dataset to ensure the data is clean and error-free.

#### 3.2.2. Key Features

| **Feature**                | **Description**                                                                           | **Example Error**                                                                            | **Data Integrity Context**                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Format Validation** | Validates that all rows follow the expected format: `Landmark_A_ID, Landmark_B_ID, Time`. | `Invalid row format: Expected 'Landmark_A_ID, Landmark_B_ID, Time'. Row: '322, invalid,33'.` | Ensures consistent data structure, reducing errors during graph creation or traversal. |
| **Duplicate Connections**  | Identifies duplicate connections between landmarks to ensure unique entries.              | `Duplicate connection found: Landmark_A_ID=322, Landmark_B_ID=333.`                          | Prevents redundant data, avoiding incorrect path calculations.                         |
| **Connectivity Check**     | Verifies that all landmarks belong to a single connected graph.                           | `Disconnected subgraph found: Node group starting from Landmark_A_ID=500.`                   | Ensures full graph connectivity, enabling reliable pathfinding.                        |
| **Graph Validation**       | Ensures the dataset forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and detects any cycles.          | `Cycle detected: Landmark_A_ID=100 -> Landmark_B_ID=200 -> Landmark_A_ID=100.`               | Avoids infinite loops and ensures logical graph traversal.                             |

##### 3.2.2.1. Data Format Validation

This module ensures the dataset adheres to the required structure for seamless processing. It addresses:

- **Missing or Additional Fields**: Each row must have exactly three values separated by commas (`Landmark_A_ID, Landmark_B_ID, Time`).
- **Non-Negative Distances**: All time values must be positive integers.
- **Data Type Consistency**: Each field must be numeric to prevent parsing errors.

> [!NOTE]  
> Example: 
> |Input line|Output|Reason|
> |---|---|---|
> |322,43,33|No output|The data follows expected format|
> |322,invalid,33| Error: `Invalid row format: Expected 'Landmark_A_ID, Landmark_B_ID, Time'. Row: '322,invalid,33'.` | One of the fields is not a number|
> |322, 43, -54| Error: `Invalid row format: Expected 'Landmark_A_ID, Landmark_B_ID, Time'. Row: '322, 43, -54'.` | One of the field has a negative distance |

---

##### 3.2.2.2. Duplicate Connections

This module ensures each connection between landmarks is declared only once. It identifies redundant entries that could lead to incorrect calculations or inflated data sizes. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Example: 
> The entries `322, 333, 10` and `322, 333, 10` in the dataset would raise an error:  
> `Duplicate connection found: Landmark_A_ID=322, Landmark_B_ID=333.`

---

##### 3.2.2.3. Connectivity Check

This module validates that all landmarks in the dataset form a single connected graph. It ensures there are no isolated nodes or subgraphs. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Example: 
> If a subgraph exists where Landmark `500` is isolated, the tool raises an error:  
> `Disconnected subgraph found: Node group starting from Landmark_A_ID=500.`

This ensures all landmarks are accessible for accurate pathfinding.

---

##### 3.2.2.4. Graph Validation

This module checks the dataset to ensure it forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It detects and reports any cycles that could disrupt graph traversal. 
> [!NOTE]  
> Example: 
> If the dataset contains a loop such as `100 -> 200 -> 100`, the tool raises an error:  
> `Cycle detected: Landmark_A_ID=100 -> Landmark_B_ID=200 -> Landmark_A_ID=100.`

By enforcing acyclic structures, the dataset supports efficient pathfinding algorithms and avoids infinite loops.

#### 3.2.3. Output

- **Log File**: 
  - The log comprehensively categorizes errors, such as duplicate connections, cycles, and disconnected subgraphs, by type
  - The log is stored in a `validation.log` file located in the same directory as the data verification tool program directory. Each entry is timestamped and formatted as follows:
 ```
 [2025-01-15 14:23:45] ERROR: Duplicate connection found: Landmark_A_ID=322, Landmark_B_ID=333.
 [2025-01-15 14:23:46] WARNING: Disconnected subgraph starting from Landmark_A_ID=500.
 ```

- **Console Output**: 
  - All errors added to the log file are also printed in the console.
  - To provide an immediate overview to the user, a summary of all the findings is printed at the end of the file execution.
  - Example console output:
 ```
 [2025-01-15 14:23:45] ERROR: Duplicate connection found: Landmark_A_ID=322, Landmark_B_ID=333.
 [2025-01-15 14:23:46] WARNING: Disconnected subgraph starting from Landmark_A_ID=500.
 -----------------------------------
 Validation Results:
 - 1 duplicate connection found.
 - 1 disconnected subgraph detected.
 - Dataset passed graph validation.
 -----------------------------------
 Validation Summary:
 - Status: Passed with warnings.
 - Issues: 3 errors detected.
 ```

### 3.3. Pathfinding Algorithm

#### 3.3.1. Overview

The pathfinding algorithm computes the shortest path between two landmarks and integrates with the REST API for seamless functionality. The algorithm is written in C++ and communicates with the REST API transforming the output into the correct JSON or XML format.

#### 3.3.2. Input Parameters

| Parameter          | Type    | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Source Node`      | Integer | Unique identifier of the starting landmark.    |
| `Destination Node` | Integer | Unique identifier of the destination landmark. |

#### 3.3.3. Output Details

| Scenario            | Return Code | Return Data                             | HTTP Code | Example Response from API                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path found          | `0`         | Path (`steps`), Total time (`time`)     | `200`     | `{"time": 66, "steps": [{"landmark": 322, "distance": 33}, {"landmark": 323, "distance": 33}]}` |
| Landmarks not found | `1`         | Missing landmarks (`missing_landmarks`) | `404`     | `{"error": {"code": 404, "message": "One or more landmarks specified are not present"}}`        |

#### 3.3.4. REST API Workflow

**API Input Validation:**
- Ensures both parameters (`landmark_1`, `landmark_2`) are present and valid.
- Checks if the landmarks are identical; if so, return `time` as `0` and `steps` as an empty array.

**Algorithm Outputs:**
- The algorithm returns its results as C++ objects. The REST API transforms these objects into the appropriate JSON or XML format for clients.
